# meh

A rich text editor, based on [`slate`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate).

A successor to `@pie-lib/editable-html`

## Issues to address

- update to date slate + libs
- focus + toolbar
- propogating changes out (no more 'onDone')
- maintain plugin feature parity (only onDone may be removed)
- remove warts that have grown in editable-html
